/**
 * A mutable reference to `A` value with read-write lock semantics:
 *  - multiple "read" operations are allowed as long as there's no "write" running or pending.
 *  - "write" operation is exclusive.
 *
 * Build it with [[ReadWriteRef.PartialApply.of `ReadWriteRef[F].of(a)`]] or
 * [[ReadWriteRef.of `ReadWriteRef.of[F, A](a)`]].
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Nested operations may ``block indefinitely`` when used to produce a result for
 * the outer scope. Not using a result of an inner operation (e.g. forking a fiber) will not block.
 *
 * @example This will block {{{
 *   rw.read.use(_ => rw.write.use(…))
 * }}}
 *
 * Cases that will currently block:
 *  - `write` in `read` or `write`.
 *  - `read`  in `read` or `write` when there is another `write` pending.
 *
 * @note Both [[ReadWriteRef.read `read`]] and [[ReadWriteRef.write `write`]] are implemented as `Resource`
 *       since it has clear mental model of something that may be "in use".
